## Performance

1. **Page load time:** 90% of pages should load in under 3 seconds.
2. **Search response time:** Search results should be displayed within 2 seconds of submitting a query.
3. **Recommendation generation:** Personalized recommendations should be generated within 5 seconds of user interaction.
4. **Payment processing:** Payment transactions should be completed within 10 seconds of user confirmation.

## Availability

1. The platform should maintain an uptime of at least 99.5% over any given period, excluding scheduled maintenance.
2. Scheduled maintenance or upgrades should not result in system downtime exceeding 4 hours per month.

## Scalability

1. The system should be able to handle a 20% increase in user traffic without performance degradation.
2. The system should be able to scale horizontally to accommodate increased data volume and user base.

## Security

1. All user data should be encrypted with industry-standard algorithms (like the AES-256).
2. Penetration testing should be conducted quarterly to identify and address security vulnerabilities.
3. Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) for critical security incidents should be within 4 hours.

## User Interface (UI) and Usability

1. 70% of users should be able to complete their desired tasks successfully on the first attempt.
2. 60% of users should be able to find the information they need on the first page they land on.
3. Users should be able to complete key tasks like booking an activity or finding recommendations within 3 minutes on average.
4. Users should be able to learn and navigate the system comfortably within 15 minutes of first use.

## Data Integrity

1. Data loss due to hardware or software failures should not exceed 0.1% per year.
2. Data accuracy should be 99.9% based on regular data validation procedures.

## Integration

1. Third-party integrations (Stripe) should be completed within the agreed timeframe with minimal disruption to the platform.
2. API response times for integrations should be under 2 seconds.

## Logging and Monitoring

1. All system activities and user interactions should be logged for auditing purposes.
2. Real-time monitoring tools should be implemented to track system performance metrics, resource utilization, and user activity, with thresholds configured for triggering alerts and notifications in case of anomalies or service degradation.

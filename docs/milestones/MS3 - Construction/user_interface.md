# User Interface

The User Interface is responsible for managing the system’s interaction with the user, provid- ing a user-friendly interface and ensuring a flawless user experience. This microservice handles user authentication, registration, and account management, as well as navigation and content presentation. It was implemented using ReactJS, which is very popular for building dy- namic user interfaces. ReactJS’s component-based architecture and efficient rendering make it an ideal choice for developing responsive and interactive web applications such as ours.

For the authentication process, the User Interface microservice interacts with an exter- nal service, FireBase, which already provides authentication mechanisms, ensuring secure access to the system. This approach simplifies the development process, as the microservice does not need to implement complex authentication mechanisms, relying on a trusted external service.

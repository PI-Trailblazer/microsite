BART is a state-of-the-art pretrained model that has been specifically designed for various natural language processing tasks, including natural language inference (NLI). In this context, text classification is achieved by pairing a document (offer description) with a potential label (tag) and feeding it into the NLI model.

The model then evaluates whether the label accurately represents the content of the text."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"One of the primary advantages of this approach is its ability to handle zero-shot learning, meaning it can classify texts into categories that were not explicitly seen during the model\u2019s training phase.

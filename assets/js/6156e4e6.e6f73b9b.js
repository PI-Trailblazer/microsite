The team will look at ways to better estimate the time required for complex tasks and adjust the sprint planning accordingly to ensure all tasks can be completed within the given timeframe. Going forward, this understanding will inform better allocation of efforts across tasks.\\n\\n## Sprint Burndown Chart\\n\\n![Burndown Chart](../../static/img/burndown_chart_sprint_1.png)"},{"id":"team_presentation","metadata":{"permalink":"/microsite/blog/team_presentation","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-03-team_presentation/Team Presentation.md","title":"The Team","description":"---","date":"2024-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 3, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":0.42,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Hugo Correia","url":"https://github.com/MrLoydHD","imageURL":"https://github.com/MrLoydHD.png","key":"hugo"},{"name":"Joaquim Rosa","url":"https://github.com/JakeRosa","imageURL":"https://github.com/JakeRosa.png","key":"jake"},{"name":"Alexandre Cotorobai","url":"https://github.com/AlexandreCotorobai","imageURL":"https://github.com/AlexandreCotorobai.png","key":"alexandre"},{"name":"Bernardo Figueiredo","url":"https://github.com/LeikRad","imageURL":"https://github.com/LeikRad.png","key":"bernardo"},{"name":"Duarte Cruz","url":"https://github.com/DuarteCruz31","imageURL":"https://github.com/DuarteCruz31.png","key":"duarte"},{"name":"Andr\xe9 Oliveira","url":"https://github.com/andreaoliveira9","imageURL":"https://github.com/andreaoliveira9.png","key":"andre"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"team_presentation","title":"The Team","authors":["hugo","jake","alexandre","bernardo","duarte","andre"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Sprint 1","permalink":"/microsite/blog/Sprint 1"}},"content":"---\\nDuring the development of our application we spread the work to be done by sprints.
